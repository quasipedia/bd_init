# TEMPLATE_PROJECT_NAME

`TEMPLATE_PROJECT_NAME` is a project using [`build123d`](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d), which in turn
is a python-based boundary representation (BREP) modeling framework, built on
the Open Cascade geometric kernel).

That is to say: **by running the code you will generate geometries that you may
later export and use for fabrication**, for example with a 3D printer.
